## Development

The application wraps the official Dropbox Paper website in an [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/) browser window _(and does some more minor things to round it up)_.

`git clone` the repository, `npm install` all dependencies and you are good to go. You might have to run `brew install wine` before building the application.
